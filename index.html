        <h2><em>Front-End Web Developer in-training<em></h2>
        <p>My name is Josh Kye, currently finishing up my last semester of university as a Computer Science major and aiming for a career in the Front-End side of Web Engineering/Development. When I'm not being so technical, I also have a artistic side to me as well, particularly in the performing arts. I am also a voice-over enthusiast, having created a number of personal projects and have even helped with live commentary on the streaming platform Twitch.</p>
